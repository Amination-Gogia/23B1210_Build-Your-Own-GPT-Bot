# Seasons of Code 2025 – Build‑Your‑Own‑GPT‑Bot

The week-wise distribution of topics covered and work done is summarized below:

- **Week 1**  
  Introduction to text preprocessing, word embeddings, and implementations using `nltk`. Implemeted a simple simple sentence-similarity-scorer based on the mean embeddings of words of sentences.

- **Week 2**  
  Covered PyTorch basics, RNNs, and LSTMs. Built a Movie-Review Sentiment Classifier achieving **80.29% test accuracy**.

- **Week 3**  
  Explored Transformers and Attention mechanisms. Used pre-trained transformer embeddings (via Hugging Face) to improve classifier performance to **84.33% accuracy** on the same news dataset.
